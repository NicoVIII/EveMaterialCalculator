This project uses the SDE (Static Data Export) from EVE Online to calculate what
is needed to craft an item.
This is an early prototype.

To use it, simply type your wanted item in English into the textbox. If it exists
you can click the "Calculate basic materials" button to show you the base materials
for the item.

To redownload the data, simply delete the created sde folder and restart the application.
There is currently no mechanic for a regular data refresh.
